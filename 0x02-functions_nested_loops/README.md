## 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing   </br>
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.</br>

You can find the source code here</br>
The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this program</br>
You don’t have to understand what rand, srand, RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code</br>
The output of the program should be:</br>
The number, followed by</br>
if the number is greater than 0: is positive</br>
if the number is 0: is zero</br>
if the number is less than 0: is negative</br>
followed by a new line</br></br>

## 1. The last digit </br>
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.</br>

The variable n will store a different value every time you run this program</br>
You don’t have to understand what rand, srand, and RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code</br>
The output of the program should be:</br>
The string Last digit of, followed by</br>
n, followed by</br>
the string is, followed by</br>
if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5</br>
if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0</br>
